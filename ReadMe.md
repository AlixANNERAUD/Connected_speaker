<h1 align="center">🔈 Connected speaker 🛜</h1>

## :rocket: Introduction

For my shindigs at home, I needed a speaker that could be tamed either via WiFi or a remote control. So, I crafted quickly a system to control remotely (either by WiFi or by infrared remote) a TDA7294 based amplifier card using of the shelf components and an ESP32. Thanks to this, the dancefloor has never been so ablaze.
